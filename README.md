# Front-end Boilerplate using Sass, TailwindCSS, Pug and Gulp 4

Using a set of files when you're starting a website project can be a huge time-saver. Instead of having to start from scratch or copy and paste from previous projects, you can get up and running in just a minute.

## Quickstart guide

* Clone or download this Git repo onto your computer.
* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you don't have it yet.
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run dev` to run the default Gulp task
* Run `npm run build` to build your project

In this proejct, Gulp is configured to run the following functions:

* Compile your Pug files to HTML
* Compile the SCSS files to CSS
* Autoprefix and minify the CSS file
* Concatenate the JS files
* Uglify the JS files
* Move final CSS and JS files to the `/dist` folder
